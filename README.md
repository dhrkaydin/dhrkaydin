Hi, I'm Kamil. I primarily work as a Java developer, but also have an interest in front-end.
Currently I am also learning some Javascript to make a portfolio website.
Aside from this I also make music, which you can find by looking up "KAM COSMIC" on your favorite streaming platform (or Youtube).

So that's all there is to it, really.
